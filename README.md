# Hi I'm Jakub üëã

I am Jakub Lyczko, frontend developer and a Computer Science student at Silesian University of Technology. I'm a big fan of **React**, **Next.js** and **Typescript** ‚ù§Ô∏è. I enjoy doing sport, reading books, programming and spending time with my friends.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working at **SAP Labs Poland**. I develop [busola](https://github.com/kyma-project/busola) which is a Web based Kubernetes Dashboard
- üì´ You can reach me by sending an e-mail on jakublyczko1@gmail.com
- üìó I am currently learning Next.js and Typescript to increase my skills in these technologies

## Technologies I use on a daily basis and feel very convenient with:

What is more, I have recently started to take an interest in **Blockchain** technologies. As an Engineering Thesis I created [dinan](https://github.com/Lyczeq/dinan) which is a platform to create your own exams and participate in the ones created by other users. As a award you get  a ‚≠êNFT‚≠ê no matter what your score is! The NFT is a proven record on the Blockchain that nobody can fake. It confirms score you've got during exam. That dinan NFT works on [polygon](https://polygon.technology/) network.
